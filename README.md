    -   Dynamic Programming\
    -   Graph Theory\
    -   Recursion\
    -   String Manipulation\
    -   Number Theory\
    -   And more...
-   Create a **video explanation for any 5 problems**, walking through:
    -   Your logic\
    -   Chosen approach\
    -   Code explanation\
    -   Optimization techniques

## 🎯 Objectives

-   **Coding Proficiency:** Write clean, efficient, and optimized
    solutions.\
