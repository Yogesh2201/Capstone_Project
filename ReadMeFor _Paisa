# 📊 Banking Data EDA & Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of banking data to identify **patterns, trends, and potential fraud risks**.  
The dataset includes financial and behavioral information about customers, which can be used to assess **creditworthiness** and detect **anomalies** that may indicate fraudulent activities.

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Understand the data structure and ensure its integrity  
- ✅ Analyze financial patterns and behavioral trends  
- ✅ Detect and visualize anomalies or patterns indicative of fraud  
- ✅ Derive actionable insights to assist in fraud detection

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Diverse Financial Information:** Rich mix of income, loans, debt, and payment behavior.  
- **Fraud Indicators:** Features like `Num_of_Delayed_Payment`, `Outstanding_Debt`, `Changed_Credit_Limit`, and `Payment_Behaviour` are strong signals of risk.  
- **Categorical Data:** Columns such as `Occupation`, `Type_of_Loan`, `Credit_Mix`, and `Credit_Score` require encoding for ML models.  
- **Potential Redundancies:** `Annual_Income` vs `Monthly_Inhand_Salary`, `Num_of_Loan` vs `Type_of_Loan`.  
- **Credit Score Insights:** Crucial for identifying risky customers.  
- **Customer Profiles:** Built using `Age`, `Occupation`, `Annual_Income`, and `Credit_History_Age`.

## 🛠️ Data Wrangling Steps
- Removed **duplicate records**  
- Checked for **missing values**  
- Dropped **irrelevant identifiers** (`Name`, `SSN`)  
- Cleaned **Payment_of_Min_Amount** column (`NM → No`)  
- Converted selected **float columns to integers** (`Num_Bank_Accounts`, `Age`, `Num_Credit_Inquiries`, `Annual_Income`)  
- Rounded monetary/ratio columns to **2 decimal places**  
- Engineered new features:
  - `Income_per_Account` = Annual_Income ÷ Num_Bank_Accounts  
  - `Credit_Score_Level` = High/Low classification based on threshold (>700)  
- Exported cleaned dataset → **`cleaned_data_final.csv`**

---

## 📈 Insights After Cleaning
- Dataset is **analysis-ready** (no duplicates, no missing values).  
- **Categorical variables standardized**, reducing ambiguity.  
- **Numeric features consistent**, enabling accurate statistical and predictive modeling.  
- Engineered features add **business value** for fraud detection and customer profiling.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Perform **EDA visualizations** (distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, fraud risk indicators).  
- Apply **feature engineering** (Debt-to-Income Ratio, Credit Usage Ratio).  
- Build **predictive models** for fraud detection using ML algorithms.  
- Deploy insights into a **dashboard** for real-time monitoring.
